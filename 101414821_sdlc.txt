The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to design, develop, and test high-quality software. 
Its goal is to produce software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, is completed within time and cost estimates, 
and functions efficiently in the current and planned IT infrastructure. SDLC provides a framework for managing software 
projects, breaking them down into distinct phases that include planning, designing, building, testing, and deploying 
software applications. Each phase has specific deliverables and milestones, ensuring that the development process is 
both systematic and controlled.

The phases of SDLC typically include requirements gathering and analysis, where business needs are understood and documented. 
Next is the design phase, where the architecture of the system is laid out. This is followed by the development phase, where 
coding is performed, based on the design. After development, the testing phase ensures that the software meets the defined 
requirements and is free of defects. After testing, the software is deployed in the live environment, followed by the 
maintenance phase, where ongoing support and improvements are handled. This iterative cycle helps teams deliver better 
software faster while reducing risks and addressing user feedback continuously.
