The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to design, develop, and test high-quality software. 
Its goal is to produce software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, is completed within time and cost estimates, 
and functions efficiently in the current and planned IT infrastructure. SDLC provides a framework for managing software 
projects, breaking them down into distinct phases that include planning, designing, building, testing, and deploying 
software applications. Each phase has specific deliverables and milestones, ensuring that the development process is 
both systematic and controlled.
