The COMP3104 DevOps course focuses on blending software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to streamline 
and automate the processes of software delivery and infrastructure management. This course introduces students to 
the principles and practices of DevOps, highlighting the importance of collaboration, automation, and continuous 
integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. It covers topics like version control with Git, automated 
testing, containerization using Docker, and cloud deployment. By learning these tools and techniques, students 
gain the skills needed to shorten development cycles, improve software quality, and enhance collaboration between 
development and operations teams.

A major emphasis of the course is on automation and monitoring. Students are introduced to automation tools like 
Jenkins, which facilitate the creation of CI/CD pipelines, allowing for seamless code integration, automated 
testing, and deployment to production environments. Additionally, they explore configuration management tools 
like Ansible or Puppet, which enable the automation of infrastructure provisioning and management. The course 
also covers monitoring tools like Nagios or Prometheus to ensure system reliability and performance, making it 
easier to detect issues before they impact users.
